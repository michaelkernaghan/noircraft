## üîß Running the Examples

Each project is a complete Noir circuit that you can compile and test:

```bash
# Navigate to any project directory
cd snark_fundamentals_demo/

# Compile the circuit
nargo build

# Run tests
nargo test

# Generate proof (if you have a prover setup)
nargo prove

# Verify proof
nargo verify
```

## üìö Key SNARK Concepts Demonstrated

### Arithmetic Circuits
- **Definition**: Directed acyclic graphs with addition, subtraction, multiplication gates
- **Purpose**: Convert computational problems into polynomial constraints
- **Size**: Number of gates determines proof generation time

### Statements vs Witnesses
- **Statement (Public)**: What the verifier knows (e.g., hash value, age range)
- **Witness (Private)**: What only the prover knows (e.g., preimage, actual age)
- **Circuit**: Defines the relationship between statement and witness

### Setup Procedures
- **Trusted Setup Per Circuit**: Requires destroying randomness for each circuit
- **Universal Setup**: One-time trusted setup, then deterministic indexing
- **Transparent Setup**: No trusted randomness needed

### SNARK Properties
- **Completeness**: Honest provers with valid witnesses always convince verifiers
- **Knowledge Soundness**: If verifier accepts, prover must know a valid witness
- **Zero-Knowledge**: Proofs reveal nothing about witnesses beyond their existence
- **Succinctness**: Proof size and verification time logarithmic in circuit size

## üåü Real-World Applications Explored

### Blockchain & DeFi
- **Private Transactions**: Transfer funds without revealing amounts/parties
- **Rollups**: Batch many transactions into one succinct proof
- **Compliance**: Prove regulatory compliance without revealing sensitive data

### Identity & Privacy
- **Anonymous Credentials**: Prove eligibility without revealing identity
- **Private Voting**: Vote anonymously while proving eligibility
- **Selective Disclosure**: Reveal only necessary identity attributes

### Financial Services
- **Solvency Proofs**: Prove reserves without revealing amounts
- **Credit Scoring**: Prove creditworthiness without revealing finances
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Prove tax compliance without revealing income

## üîç Understanding the Trade-offs

| System | Proof Size | Setup | Verification | Post-Quantum | Best For |
|--------|------------|-------|--------------|---------------|----------|
| **Groth16** | ~200 bytes | Trusted per circuit | ~3ms | No | Blockchain rollups |
| **PLONK** | ~400 bytes | Universal trusted | ~5ms | No | Enterprise privacy |
| **STARKs** | ~80KB | Transparent | ~20ms | Yes | Long-term security |
