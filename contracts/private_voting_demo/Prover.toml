# Example proving inputs for a Yes vote
# Private inputs (kept secret)
vote = "1"              # Voting Yes
voter_secret = "12345"  # Voter's secret key

# Public inputs (visible on-chain)
proposal_id = "1"       # Proposal #1

# These would be computed by the voter's wallet

# For this example, we'll let the circuit verify them
